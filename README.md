# Chip8 assembler
## Syntax
````asm
label INST arg1, arg2, arg3
````

## Instructions
All chip8 instructions are supported, but no extensions (e.g. Super Chip-48) are supported, yet.
In addition, we support the instruction `.fill`, that simple puth the content of argument 1 in the memory location

# TODO
More tests.

Currently we have two tests, one that test that all instructions are translated corretly, 
and on that tests the same code with different whitespace.
